# Convert
## Convert an Outline into a Directory and File Structure
Once your outline is complete, you can run the `convert` command to generate a directory structure and set of files based on your `outline.md` file. The convert command will create directories for parts, files for chapters, and headings within the chapter files for sections and subsections. Conceptually, the structure of a Tanagra-based book, before compiling to final output, will look like this:

- **Content** (directory; contains book content)
   - **Part** (directory; breaks up book into one or more parts; required)
      - **Chapter** (\*.md file; one file per chapter)
         - **Section** (text heading; added as an H2 heading to the chapter file)
            - **Subsection** (text heading; added as an H3 heading to the chapter file)

**#TODO:** Media (need to figure out this part of the project)

The _Content_ directory (first level) is generated by creating the book template. The directories, files, and heading text (within markdown files) created below the _Content_ directory is generated by converting the outline file.

*The `tanagra convert` command will convert the `outline.md` file into the directory and file structure seen outlined in purple.*

## _tagangra convert_
Run the `convert` command to convert the `outline.md` markdown file into a book directory and file structure in the `content/` directory and adds section and subsection headings to chapter markdown files.

```bash
$ tanagra convert
```

The following is the sample outline that comes with your generated Tanagra book project:
```
# Table of Contents (Outline)

1. Part 0 - Part Title
   1. Chapter 0 - Chapter Title
      1. Section Title
         1. Subsection Title
      1. Section Title
         1. Subsection Title
   1. Chapter 1 - Chapter Title
      1. Section Title
         1. Subsection Title
      1. Section Title
         1. Subsection Title

1. Part 1 - Part Title
   1. Chapter 2 - Chapter Title
      1. Section Title
         1. Subsection Title
      1. Section Title
         1. Subsection Title
   1. Chapter 3 - Chapter Title
      1. Section Title
         1. Subsection Title
      1. Section Title
         1. Subsection Title
```

Given that outline, if you ran the convert command against that `outline.md` file, the resulting directory and file structure would look like this:
```
project_directory/
   content/
      book_project_name/
         Part 0 - Part Title/
            Chapter 1 - Chapter Title.md
               Section Title (text heading)
                  Subsection Title (text heading)
            Chapter 2 - Chapter Title.md
               Section Title (text heading)
                  Subsection Title (text heading)
         Part 1 - Part Title/
            Chapter 3 - Chapter Title.md
               Section Title (text heading)
                  Subsection Title (text heading)
            Chapter 4 - Chapter Title.md
               Section Title (text heading)
                  Subsection Title (text heading)
#TODO: media/ (need to figure out this part of the project)
```

## Next Steps
Now that your book directory and file structure has been generated, you can write your book in the `content/` directory and generated \*.md files. When your book is complete, you can [compile your markdown into a rendered book](compile.html).
