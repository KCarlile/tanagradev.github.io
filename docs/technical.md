# Technical Information

## Tanagra Script
Tanagra is a Python 3.7.5-based tool that leverages the [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) library for converting markdown into e-book formats (PDF, EPUB, HTML).

The project is hosted on GitHub and can be found here: [https://github.com/TanagraDev/tanagra](https://github.com/TanagraDev/tanagra)

This project was built on a Mac using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for dependencies. At some point, the project may be extended to support Windows and Linux.

The project includes some interactive features, but mostly requires the user to be in the directory in which they would like to execute the commands, similar to how Git works.

Currently, the `tanagra` script, which is the entry point for the program, accepts one of three commands: `build`, `convert`, and `compile`.

## Tanagra.dev
