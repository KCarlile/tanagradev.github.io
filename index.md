# Tanagra
## Markdown Book Pipeline Tool

Tanagra is a documentation pipeline tool for building a template for a markdown-based book, generating a directory and file structure based on an outline, and then converting markdown files into HTML, PDF, and EPUB books using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

In short, Tanagra works like this:
- You tell Tanagra where you want to start a project and it creates the necessary files.
- You create an outline and Tanagra converts that outline into a directory and file structure for that book.
- You write your book in markdown.
- When you're done with your book, you tell Tanagra the format (PDF, EPUB, or HTML) in which you'd like to publish your book.
- You distribute your book to lucky readers! :)

## "Tah-NAH-grah"
It's pronounced *tah-NAH-grah* as in ["Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok) Hear it pronounced: [The Enterprise meets the Tamarians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-wzr74d7TI)

Why *Tanagra?* Well, it's a great episode and it's about learning to communicate and translate. The Tanagra script is about facilitating communication and translating one format into another.
